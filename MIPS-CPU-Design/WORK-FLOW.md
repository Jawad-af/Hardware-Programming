# THE STEPS FOR DESIGNING AND PROGRAMMING A MIPS-ARCHITECTURE-BASED CPU OF 16-BIT 

----------------------------------------------------------


1. Define the instruction set for MIPS 16

	- We will use R-type, I-type and J-type instruction formats.
	- Specify the encoding (on bits) in all of the fields from the instruction.
	- Write the RTL abstract for all the instructions from the MIPS16 instruction set.

2. MIPS16 test program 
	
	- Write a short program with the instruction that you have defined for the MIPS16 processor.
	- Describe the program in assembly language.
	- Describe each instruction in machine code.
	
3. Data-Path for MIPS16

	- Draw the Data-Path with all the necessery components.
	- Starting from the RTL abstract description, identify the values of the control signals for each instruction.
	- Draw a table with the control signals and their values.
